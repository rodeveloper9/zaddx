                    without infringing the rights and the request of the user to not process the data further.
                </p>
                <h5>User restrictions on processing of personal details shall be applicable in the following
                    cases:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>When the accuracy of the data is contested, processing of the data will be restricted
                            until the required changes are made to make the data accurate.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When the user objects to data processing and zaddx.com considers such an
                            objection.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When the data is unlawfully processed but the user does not insist on deleting the
                            data.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When zaddx.com does not require the personal data but only to the extent of
                            establishing, exercising and defending a legal claim.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In case the data is disclosed to any third parties, the details about the restriction will be
                    disclosed to them unless otherwise it is impossible or should require disproportional
                    effort. Once we decide to lift a restriction on processing the user data the user will be
                    notified of the same. </p>
                <h4>Objecting User data processing</h4>
                <p>Users can object to the processing of user data free of charge. This is not an absolute right
                    but the users can register their objections in the following situations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>When it is based on legitimate interests grounds</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>For the research purposes</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>zaddx.com will stop processing the user’s personal data unless otherwise there are
                    compelling legitimate grounds for processing such requests that override the interests and
                    rights of the user and in situations whereby such data is being processed to establish,
                    exercise or defend our legal claims. </p>
                <p>Users can object and stop us from using their data for direct marketing purposes. Such
                    requests shall be processed as soon as the requests are received. In this case, there are no
                    exceptions or reasons or grounds on which zaddx.com can refuse your request. </p>
                <h4>User Data Portability</h4>
                <p>Data portability allows us to collect and use the personal data of the user for their own
                    purposes across different services offered by zaddx.com. This is applicable in the
                    following situations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>When the user has shared their personal data with the company directly.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When we process the data either based on the user's consent or it is required for the
                            execution of the contract</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When the processing is done through automated systems.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>zaddx.com shall provide the data free of charge in a format that is compatible for
                    machine reading and in a commonly used structure. The company aims to provide the user data
                    in one month time after receiving the request from the user unless otherwise the process is
                    complex or if the user has placed several requests. In such situations the expected response
                    time is three months. In case more than one month is required for processing of the data we
                    will intimate you of the same and provide you with the reason for the same. </p>
                <p>In case we are not able to provide the user data the same will be intimated to you explaining
                    the reasons for which we are unable to provide the data. </p>
